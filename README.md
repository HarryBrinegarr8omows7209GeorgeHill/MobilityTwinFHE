## Why FHE Matters

- **Citizen Privacy:** Individual locations and movement patterns remain confidential  
- **Secure Urban Analysis:** Enables large-scale simulations without accessing raw mobility data  
- **Collaboration-Friendly:** Multiple stakeholders (cities, researchers, transport authorities) can collaborate without sharing sensitive data  
- **High-Fidelity Modeling:** Preserves data granularity while ensuring ethical compliance

## Use Cases

1. **Urban Traffic Optimization**
   - Test changes to traffic lights, signal timing, or road layouts  
   - Evaluate effects of new infrastructure before implementation  

2. **Public Transport Planning**
   - Optimize bus and subway routes based on encrypted passenger flow  
   - Simulate peak hour scenarios without exposing personal commutes  

3. **Event & Emergency Planning**
   - Predict congestion during concerts, festivals, or emergencies  
   - Adjust urban mobility strategies in real-time using encrypted inputs  

4. **Sustainable Mobility Research**
   - Model pedestrian, cycling, and shared vehicle usage  
   - Plan eco-friendly transportation initiatives while protecting privacy
